### Privacy Policy  
----------------

This privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at Passwordzzz, how Passwordzzz uses it, and what choices you have.
Sayan Kabir built the Passwordzzz app as a free open source app. This SERVICE is provided  at no cost and is intended for use as is.
The app has been developed with security and privacy as topmost priority in mind. The app collects no sensitive personal or device data.
It utilizes local database to store passwords and related data. You may choose to delete or modify them at any time and only you have access to it. None of it is collected elsewhere.
The app is stable and the database is durable as per my knowledge. However, the developer doesn't take any resposibility for loss of data due to user's misactions ,or damage or theft of the device.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me .
